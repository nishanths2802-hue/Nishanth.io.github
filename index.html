    <p>
        A journey becomes memorable not merely because of the destination, but because of the emotions, people, and moments that shape it. 
        The journey I took with my school friends after completing our secondary education in May 2022 is one such unforgettable experience. 
        For years we had called ourselves “the crazy gang,” and true to our name, we carried with us a spirit of excitement, mischief, and togetherness. 
        After the exam results were announced, we often spoke about celebrating the end of school life with a special trip. Ooty and Black Thunder theme park 
        quickly became our dream destination, a place where we imagined we could forget every academic stress and simply enjoy life.

    <p>
        Our planning was filled with playful arguments about dates, expenses, travel routes, and what snacks to bring. After a long discussion, we finally fixed 
        the journey for June 22, 2024, marking a significant moment for all of us. But as expected, no adventure begins without challenges. On the very morning 
        of our departure, one of my closest friends suddenly announced that he would not be joining us. His parents were hesitant and worried about the safety 
        of a road trip. The news left all of us upset, but as a team that never accepted defeat easily, we decided to convince them. After repeated calls, 
        explanations, negotiations, and reassurances, they finally agreed, and we brought him along with us.

    <p>
        That victory alone felt like the first success of the trip. With everyone together, the excitement rose instantly. By 7 p.m., we rented a car, loaded our bags, 
        connected the speakers, and began our three-day adventure. The moment we left the city, a wave of freedom washed over us. The songs we played filled the car 
        with energy, and each of us felt that we were stepping into a new phase of life.

        The roads leading to Ooty offered a unique blend of thrill and beauty. As night fell, the sky turned into a deep black canvas scattered with stars. A cool breeze 
        brushed our faces through the half-open windows, giving the feeling that the journey itself was welcoming us. The winding forest roads were mysterious, and every 
        unexpected movement of an animal on the roadside made us shout, laugh, or freeze for a second. But those moments were honest — they showed us how alive and alert 
        we were as we travelled through the unknown. Every kilometre we crossed added a new memory, from midnight hunger to silly jokes, from loud laughter to quiet 
        reflections as we looked outside at the passing trees. It was not merely a journey across a physical distance; it felt like travelling from adolescence into young adulthood.

    <h2>The Experience at Black Thunder</h2>

    <p>
        When we reached Black Thunder the next morning, the sun was bright, the air fresh, and our spirits already high. As we collected the entrance tickets, we could 
        hardly contain our excitement. The first sight that caught our eyes inside the theme park was the massive wave pool, with water splashing joyfully and people 
        laughing continuously. We rushed to the changing rooms and jumped into the pool within minutes. The chilled water touched our skin like a sudden surprise, 
        refreshing and exhilarating at the same time.
    </p>

    <p>
        One of my friends slipped while entering the pool and did an unplanned flip, making us all burst into laughter. That moment set the tone for the rest of the day. 
        After enjoying the waves and taking countless pictures, we headed toward the water slides, including the legendary Bullet Ride, known to be the park’s scariest slide. 
        As I climbed the stairs toward the top, my heart began pounding. I could hear the distant screams of riders echoing through the park, and suddenly I felt both fear 
        and excitement rush through me.
    </p>

    <p>
        When my turn finally came, I closed my eyes for a moment, took a deep breath, and pushed myself forward. For a split second, it felt like falling through emptiness. 
        The speed, the wind, the cold water — everything struck me at once. And then, just as quickly, I was at the bottom, laughing uncontrollably. It was one of the most 
        thrilling experiences of my life, and from that moment, Bullet Ride became my personal favourite.
    </p>

    <p>
        The rest of the day was packed with joy. We explored the Lazy River, danced in the Rain Disco, attempted the Cyclone Ride, and sped down the Family Slide together. 
        Every ride brought out a different emotion — fear, excitement, amusement, curiosity, and pride. By evening, our clothes were soaked, our legs tired, but our hearts full. 
        The experience at Black Thunder was not just fun; it was liberating.

    <h2>Reflections on the Journey</h2>

    <p>
        Looking back today, I realise how deeply this journey has shaped me. Travelling with friends, independently and without the guiding presence of parents, taught me 
        lessons that no classroom ever could. I learned how to navigate uncertainty, make decisions under pressure, and manage unexpected situations calmly. I also discovered 
        how beautiful it feels to step out of one’s comfort zone and enter spaces that challenge one’s fears.
    </p>

    <p>
        This journey gave me confidence to travel more, explore new places, and trust myself in unfamiliar environments. It showed me that life becomes meaningful when we 
        allow experiences to change us. Many times people hesitate to travel because of fear, overthinking, or discomfort. But this journey proved to me that every step we 
        take into the unknown becomes a step toward personal growth.
    </p>

    <p>
        Today when I reflect on the journey, I do not simply remember the places we visited. I remember the laughter, the struggles, the fear before the Bullet Ride, the 
        peaceful moments of the night drive, and the reassuring presence of my friends. Each of these memories is a reminder that the journey was as important as the destination.

    <h2>People Who Influenced the Journey — Past</h2>

    <p>
        In the past, my friends played a significant role in shaping the trip. Without their energy, humor, and companionship, the journey would have felt incomplete. 
        They took responsibilities, made decisions, helped each other, and ensured that no one felt left out. Their presence turned a simple road trip into a lively adventure.

        Even small interactions made a difference. For example, during the journey we stopped at a roadside tea shop. The owner,
